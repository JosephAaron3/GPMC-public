Code corresponding to the paper "Variance reduction for noisy gamma process likelihood estimation".

The data_generation.py file generates the synthetic datasets used in the paper. experiments.py (with comments included) is the main file to run the experiments detailed in the paper. experiments_optimized.py is equivalent to this, but with some coding changes to help with run speed.
